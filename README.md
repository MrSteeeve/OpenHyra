**English** | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

An open, partial reproduction of the public architecture of Tencent Hunyuan's
**Hyra** (Hunyuan Research Agent) harness [1], currently demonstrated on the
**sums_diffs** task: an autonomous loop in which LLM agents
propose solvers, a sandbox runs them, a trusted evaluator scores them, and
every outcome, whether success or failure, is banked as experience for the next round.

## The task

Construct a finite set of integers $A$ maximizing the sum-vs-difference exponent

$$C(A) = \frac{\log\left(|A+A| \/\ |A|\right)}{\log\left(|A-A| \/\ |A|\right)}$$

where $A+A = \{a+b : a,b \in A\}$ and $A-A = \{a-b : a,b \in A\}$.

For most sets $C(A) < 1$, since addition commutes and differences tend to
outnumber sums; sum-dominant ("MSTD") constructions push it above 1 [4].

We follow the public **SimpleTES sums_diffs task requirements** [3]:
$2 \le |A| \le 512$, elements within $[-10^6, 10^6]$, a hard 180-second
candidate timeout, and exact enumeration of $A+A$ and $A-A$ by a trusted
evaluator outside the sandbox. Nothing a candidate reports about itself is
ever trusted.

## Results

| System | $C(A)$ |
|---|---:|
| Official seed (17-element initial construction) | 1.059793 |
| **OpenHyra legacy run** | **1.111815** ($n = 405$) |
| SimpleTES [3] | 1.144887 |

All rows above use the declared SimpleTES v1 protocol. Hyra's published
1.159715 artifact [1, 2] is a cross-protocol reference only: its 181,131
elements exceed the $|A|\le512$ constraint and it is therefore not included in
the comparison table.

The OpenHyra set was found by a Codex-backed historical run (20 Context rounds
× 4 candidates per round), scored by the trusted evaluator and independently
re-verified: $n=405$, $|A+A|=2395$, $|A-A|=2003$. That run predates the current
all-outcomes and immutable-repair EB semantics: it retained one winner artifact
per Context and summaries for the other candidates. The set and standalone
verifier are published as a clearly labelled
[legacy artifact](artifacts/sums_diffs/openhyra-1.111814562869239-legacy/);
the current harness has not yet been rerun for a replacement headline result.

## How it works

                             └──────────────────┘        results
```

**Experience Bank** — every candidate's code, artifacts, logs and metrics,
committed as independent records whether it succeeded, crashed, or scored low.

**Context Agent** — an LLM that reads a structured summary of all records,
recent logs, recent failures and the current-best implementation, writes a
short situation analysis (persisted as cross-round memory), and picks the next
experiment direction. It does not yet retrieve arbitrary historical source
trees or artifacts.

**Proposal Agents** — headless Claude Code or Codex CLI processes that edit the
solver inside dedicated draft directories using backend-specific permissions;
these directories organize and validate changes but are not a uniform OpenHyra
OS security boundary. Each Context briefing fans out to several independent
candidates, and proposal generation overlaps evaluation.

**Sandbox + trusted evaluation** — candidates run under macOS Seatbelt with no
network and writes confined to the sandbox. Most host reads remain allowed, so
this is write-confinement rather than a confidentiality sandbox. Candidate
`solution.json` files are accepted only as bounded, single-link regular files,
copied into a candidate-inaccessible trusted directory, and scored there. An
integrity whitelist rejects changes beyond the declared editable files, an AST
preflight catches known crash patterns, and every failed/repaired attempt is
stored as an immutable EB record linked by `repair_of`.

Each run freezes code, task, evaluator, model, concurrency, limits, seed and
stopping policy in `run_manifest.json`. Resume is refused if result-affecting
provenance drifts, and a process lock prevents two harnesses from writing the
same `run-id`.

### Guarded Agent stopping

Active stopping is opt-in with `--agent-stop`; `--iterations` is the
per-invocation upper bound. When enabled, Context rounds are sequential so each
decision sees the prior round's complete EB, while the candidates inside a
round still run concurrently. A Context `stop` is only a request. The
deterministic controller accepts it only after, by default, at least 6 completed
Contexts, 4 Contexts
without a meaningful gain of `0.0001`, and at least 4 successful candidates in
the latest 4 Contexts. Invalid Context JSON or a failed Context call always
continues. Every invocation writes its termination reason and evidence to
`termination.json`; an accepted stop also includes the raw Agent decision and
the controller review. The file is included in exported bundles.

`expected_gain` and `confidence` are recorded as Agent telemetry only; they do
not participate in the deterministic stop review. Context input is bounded to
80 representative EB records and 96,000 characters, preserving recent records,
the historical best, representative failures, direction coverage and aggregate
counts. A run with an incomplete Context fails closed on resume, and a
`terminal=true` run must be continued under a new `--run-id`. On Ctrl+C the
Harness cancels active CLI/solver process groups and joins all pipeline threads
before writing terminal state and releasing the run lock.

```bash
python3 harness.py --run-id guarded --init --workers 2 --agent-stop
python3 harness.py --run-id guarded --iterations 20 --workers 2 --agent-stop
```

The guards can be configured with `--min-contexts-before-stop`,
`--stop-patience`, `--stop-min-delta`, `--stop-recent-window`, and
`--stop-min-successful-candidates`. Use identical values when initializing and
resuming a run.

## Quick start

```bash
# Requirements: macOS, Python >= 3.10, numpy, and the Claude Code or Codex CLI
python3 harness.py --run-id demo --init --workers 2
python3 harness.py --run-id demo --iterations 5 --workers 2
python3 harness.py --run-id demo --status
python3 harness.py --run-id demo --export-bundle bundles/demo
```

Pass the same `--backend`, `--model`, `--workers`, candidate count and trial
seed and stopping options at initialization and resume. To change them, start a
new `--run-id`.
